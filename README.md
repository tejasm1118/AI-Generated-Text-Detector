AI-Generated Text Detector 

The primary goal or motivation of this project is to create an effective machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between student-written essays and those generated by large language models (LLMs). By achieving this, we can contribute to ongoing efforts to combat plagiarism and ensure the authenticity of academic content.
